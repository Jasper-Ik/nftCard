## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow



### What I learned
 -flex Box

 CSS Flexible Box Layout is a module of CSS that defines a CSS box model optimized for user interface design, and the layout of items in one dimension. In the flex layout model, the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction, and can "flex" their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent. Both horizontal and vertical alignment of the children can be easily manipulated.

 Common flex box properties:

 CSS Properties
flex
flex-basis
flex-direction
flex-flow
flex-grow
flex-shrink
flex-wrap
order

e.g from my design process

```
connft {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    text-align: left;
}
```

  Grid
A grid is a set of intersecting horizontal and vertical lines defining columns and rows. Elements can be placed onto the grid within these column and row lines.

e.g as uded in my solution for the overall layout for the container,

```
.container {
    display: grid;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
  
}
```



### Continued development

-the Grid box

### Useful resources

- [Mozilla fire fox resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Grid_Layout#grid_lines) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [CSS & HTML resource 2](https://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189) - This is an amazing article and book which helped me finally understand grid and css layout. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
